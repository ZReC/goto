# URL redirector

The idea is to be able to edit the redirection of an image (for example) if its host stops working.

## Base64 names
The [urls](urls) folder contains files of 6-character long randomly generated names

Currently the valid characters are [A-Z][a-z][0-9][_][-]. I might add more in the future just for fun ðŸŽˆ

A name can be generated [here](https://zrec.github.io/to/rng.htm).

## Examples

This should redirect to github.com
> https://zrec.github.io/to?6_V-io

Here is another example:
